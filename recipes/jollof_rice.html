		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			 Jollof rice is a beloved West African dish with many regional variations. It's made with a unique blend of spices, long-grain rice, and a tomato and red pepper base. It is often served as a hearty entrée by adding beef, chicken, goat, or fish, or as is as a side. Jollof rice can be made for any occasion from birthdays and holiday celebrations to a casual weeknight dinner.

			 Reflecting on my first experience eating jollof rice, I now see that the familiarity I felt was the thread between ancestral and descendant recipes. Jollof rice didn't just evolve throughout Africa but also in the Americas. I grew up enjoying foods like jambalaya and red rice, which mirror jollof in their preparation and community—offsprings rooted in the transatlantic migration and the ingenuity of my ancestors. 

			 I am comforted by these connective tissues. And I now make jollof rice often—this recipe represents my journey to a one-pot jollof rice that will leave flavor memories that live rent-free in your head.
