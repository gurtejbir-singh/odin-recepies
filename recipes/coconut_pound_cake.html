		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			 This coconut pound cake comes together with just a few simple ingredients: flour, butter, sugar, sour cream, and unsweetened shredded coconut and coconut milk for a boost of coconutty flavor. Plus, you can mix the batter in just one bowl with a spoon.
			 It turns out deliciously moist with a tender crumb. It’s nice and dense, as all pound cakes should be, yet pillowy soft. It’s not overly sweet—perfect with a cup of coffee, topped with a scoop of ice cream, or just as is.
			 Serve it for a special occasion or have it out on the counter for your family to enjoy throughout the week.
